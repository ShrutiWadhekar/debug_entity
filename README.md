unification of patient records across different hospitals and practitioners maintained on a common unified server .
The website code here demonstrates the basic structure of the solution . 
Goal: As patients often visit many doctors and hospitals over the course of the treatment records get scattered and are often rendered useless. Upon unification of records we can solve this problem. 

Portals- 1. Doctor 
         2. User
        
User- The patient can view and modify his records initially after signing up.
Doctor- The doctor after recieving permission from patient can view the patients medical history and basic information and after checkup            the doctor shall add the analysis and new reports to the patient's database.
